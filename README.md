##Learning Experience

This project encompassed everything we have learned in the course in the last two months in additon to using Wordpress and PHP for the first time. This project was extremely challenging as it has so many pieces and there was a very short time period to complete it. There are many areas of this project that improved my understanding of areas that I did not have a good grasp on in the past; However, there are still many areas to be completed in order to fully meet the designers vision of this site.
